      "As a Senior Front End Engineer with 9 years of diverse experience, I've overseen projects spanning a multitude of domains, from implementing serverless solutions using Lambda/Dynamo/SQS to configuring Linux servers for LAMP stacks.",
      "As a Frontend Tech Lead, I successfully tackled numerous technical challenges, adapting tools like Webpack and PostCSS to implement advanced performance optimizations. I implemented techniques such as TypeScript strict mode, introduced static analysis with Sonar, and integrated real-time error monitoring to minimize human errors. It allowed to enhance overall product quality.",
      "Additionally, I improved project builds, doubling their speed by introducing <a href='https://nx.dev/concepts/more-concepts/incremental-builds' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>incremental builds</a> and transitioning our CI from Teamcity to GitHub Actions to allow parallelize the process. Simultaneously, I played a pivotal role in team growth, contributing to the expansion from 6 to 12 frontend engineers by actively participating in the hiring process as an interviewer."

So many of them I had to analyze and research. A few such problems and solutions: <br> <br>  <ul>     <li>         <strong>Problem:</strong> We can't ship features fast. CI (TeamCity) accumulates a queue, a build has taken a lot of time.         <br/><strong>Solution:</strong> I've proposed and realized to migrate from TeamCity to Github Actions, then we've switched to <a href='https://nx.dev/ci/incremental-builds' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>incremental builds approach</a> which significantly accelerated the speed of building our frontend mono repository (<a href='https://nx.dev/documentation/shared/incremental-build-webpack-vs-incremental.png' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>pic</a> describing why)     </li>         <br> <li>         <strong>Problem:</strong> Sometimes we had errors like `undefined is not a...`.         <br/><strong>Solution:</strong> We've enabled typescript strict mode (incremental builds approach allowed us to make an iterative transition enabling for all new libs and slowly turning on for older ones.). Additionally, we improved ESLint (switched to full configs, added new plugins and more).     </li>   <br>     <li>         <strong>Problem:</strong> Sometimes pages load and render slowly. Lighthouse shows up metrics in a red zone.         <br/><strong>Solution:</strong> Decrease influence of zone.js (partial disable), inspect problems and \"slow code\" via chrome dev tools (perf tab). Enabling speed-ups in Cloudflare. As a result, we got into the green zone on some pages.     </li>  </ul>  <br>Aside from the technical stuff I've mentored, troubleshot, had sessions dedicated to architecture, one-on-one sessions, interviews (recruitment).
