So many of them I had to analyze and research. A few such problems and solutions: <br> <br>  <ul>     <li>         <strong>Problem:</strong> We can't ship features fast. CI (TeamCity) accumulates a queue, a build has taken a lot of time.         <br/><strong>Solution:</strong> I've proposed and realized to migrate from TeamCity to Github Actions, then we've switched to <a href='https://nx.dev/ci/incremental-builds' target='_blank'>incremental builds approach</a> which significantly accelerated the speed of building our frontend mono repository (<a href='https://nx.dev/documentation/shared/incremental-build-webpack-vs-incremental.png' target='_blank'>pic</a> describing why)     </li>         <br> <li>         <strong>Problem:</strong> Sometimes we had errors like `undefined is not a...`.         <br/><strong>Solution:</strong> We've enabled typescript strict mode (incremental builds approach allowed us to make an iterative transition enabling for all new libs and slowly turning on for older ones.). Additionally, we improved ESLint (switched to full configs, added new plugins and more).     </li>   <br>     <li>         <strong>Problem:</strong> Sometimes pages load and render slowly. Lighthouse shows up metrics in a red zone.         <br/><strong>Solution:</strong> Decrease influence of zone.js (partial disable), inspect problems and \"slow code\" via chrome dev tools (perf tab). Enabling speed-ups in Cloudflare. As a result, we got into the green zone on some pages.     </li>  </ul>  <br>Aside from the technical stuff I've mentored, troubleshot, had sessions dedicated to architecture, one-on-one sessions, interviews (recruitment). We managed to launch a bonus program for engineers üí∞"
