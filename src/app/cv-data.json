Additionally, we improved ESLint (switched to full configs, added new plugins and more).     </li>   <br>     <li>         <strong>Problem:</strong> Sometimes pages load and render slowly. Lighthouse shows up metrics in a red zone.         <br/><strong>Solution:</strong> Decrease influence of zone.js (partial disable), inspect problems and \"slow code\" via chrome dev tools (perf tab). Enabling speed-ups in Cloudflare. As a result, we got into the green zone on some pages.     </li>  </ul>  <br>Aside from the technical stuff I've mentored, troubleshot, had sessions dedicated to architecture, one-on-one sessions, interviews (recruitment).

Upon joining, we transitioned from a monolithic setup (.NET, jQuery) to a modern microservices approach. This marked a crucial phase in my developer journey, focusing on redesign and tech updates. Technologies like Angular, GraphQL, and a Tailwind-based component design system brought the product up to industry standards.<br/><br/>Selecting Angular's second version, we swiftly developed a mobile SPA within a few months. Initially, our expertise in Angular/RxJS was limited, resulting in minor code smell and potential performance issues, like subscribe returning another subscription or forgetting to unsubscribe. Yet, with team growth, we proactively addressed these challenges. In a year, we made noticeable strides, incorporating advanced RxJS features (e.g., custom operators) for efficient reactive interfaces. We optimized with Zone.js and implemented comprehensive ESLint and TypeScript checks, underscoring our dedication to continuous improvement and staying current with evolving technologies.<br/>Beyond frontend work, I delved into serverless microservices (Lambda, NoSQL). Notably, during COVID-19, I developed a serverless microservice for ETA on public transport using a <a href='https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>GEOHASH</a> approach, reducing Google Maps API calls and costs without sacrificing accuracy.<br/><br/>What made this job rewarding was the sense of purpose in each solution. It wasn't just about the product; it was about assisting people in finding jobs and enhancing the user experience in every task. The creative work environment, along with collaboration among team members, fostered a positive workplace. Lasting connections were formed, and many of them remain friends to this day. It created an ideal environment for personal and professional growth. Starting as a middle developer, I progressed to Tech Lead, showcasing continuous learning and leadership opportunities here."
