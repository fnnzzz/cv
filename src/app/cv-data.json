I actively participated in interviews and contributed to expanding the frontend team from 6 to 12 developers. Beyond technical challenges, I engaged in people management, assisting with problem resolution and architecting new features.<br/>I implemented a rewards and bonus system, enhancing motivation and addressing issues in processes like code reviews. On the technical front, I conducted research to address global issues reported by developers, product owners, or users. Some examples include:<ul><br/><li><b>Problem:</b> The production occasionally experienced app crashes, hindering seamless user interaction. Some errors were human oversight, not easily detectable during code reviews or testing.<br/><b>Solution:</b> Implemented a strategic shift to TypeScript strict mode, compelling developers to include additional checks, significantly reducing the occurrence of errors. Expanded ESLint checks with various plugins to catch potential issues. Integrated SonarQube for syntax analysis, highlighting common code smells and security problems in pull requests. The addition of Sentry enabled precise tracking of client-side errors, pinpointing the responsible developer for automatic assignment and swift resolution.</li></br><li><b>Problem:</b> CI delays and queues due to a large team and monorepo.<br/><b>Solution:</b> Proposed a transition from TeamCity to GitHub Actions, providing a possibility to scale a number of build-agents compared to TeamCity. Introduced caching for built libraries and <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://nx.dev/concepts/more-concepts/incremental-builds'>incremental builds</a> to optimize build times. This comprehensive approach reduced average build times from ~40 to ~20 minutes and completely eliminated queue problems by dynamically scaling agents.<br/><br/><li><b>Problem:</b> Poor web vitals affecting UX and SEO.<br/><b>Solution:</b> Initially, leveraged Cloudflare optimizations to enhance overall performance. Focused on optimizing static content with caching strategies, preloading/precaching, and more. Investigated code-related issues and identified tools like <a href='https://www.rx-angular.io/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>RxAngular</a> to significantly reduce \"zone.js\" impact on performance. Resulted in transitioning some pages from red to yellow-green zones, substantially improving web vitals metrics such as loading speed, first contentful paint, and smoothness.</li></br><li><b>Problem:</b> Developers sought a more streamlined DX for routine tasks like library generation and GraphQL schema regeneration.<br/><b>Solution:</b> Introduced a variety of node tools that operate in interactive modes with prompts and autocompletion. This empowered developers to execute routine tasks effortlessly without the need to memorize complex commands. This approach significantly improved efficiency and made mundane tasks straightforward.</li></ul><br/>In summary, my technical role involved extensive R&D to tackle global challenges. This experience was fantastic, and I thrive in environments that demand experimentation and problem-solving. It was a great opportunity to enhance my leadership skills."

Technologies like Angular, GraphQL, and a Tailwind-based component design system brought the product up to industry standards.<br/><br/>Selecting Angular's second version, we swiftly developed a mobile SPA within a few months. Initially, our expertise in Angular/RxJS was limited, resulting in minor code smell and potential performance issues, like subscribe returning another subscription or forgetting to unsubscribe. Yet, with team growth, we proactively addressed these challenges. In a year, we made noticeable strides, incorporating advanced RxJS features (e.g., custom operators) for efficient reactive interfaces. We optimized with Zone.js and implemented comprehensive ESLint and TypeScript checks, underscoring our dedication to continuous improvement and staying current with evolving technologies.<br/>Beyond frontend work, I delved into serverless microservices (Lambda, NoSQL). Notably, during COVID-19, I developed a serverless microservice for ETA on public transport using a <a href='https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>GEOHASH</a> approach, reducing Google Maps API calls and costs without sacrificing accuracy.<br/><br/>What made this job rewarding was the sense of purpose in each solution. It wasn't just about the product; it was about assisting people in finding jobs and enhancing the user experience in every task. The creative work environment, along with collaboration among team members, fostered a positive workplace. Lasting connections were formed, and many of them remain friends to this day.
